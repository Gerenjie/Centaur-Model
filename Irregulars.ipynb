    "### Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to confirm that we can identify detections of jovian moons in PS1 smf files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect relevant smf files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the mid-time of each smf file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the ephemerides for bright-ish jovian irregular moons for those times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Detection Efficiency Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine having a bunch of potential detections near a particular exposure, from actual stars and moving solar system bodies.  These are represented by RA, Dec, magnitude, colors, and maybe rate of motion.  The quantities are all physical, from a bunch of photons perhaps at the top of the atmosphere.  In reality these potential detections travel through the atmosphere and telescope optics and onto the focal plane.  Depending upon where they land, how bright source is, and other properties, this might result in a detection being written by the IPP into an smf file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to simulate this process.  We generate a set of potential detections from a solar system model.  The model comprises a set of orbits and magnitudes (possibly variable).  We propagate those orbits to the times of each exposure.  If the resulting positions are plausibly within the field of view of the exposure, we look in more detail through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use the RA/Dec and the global WCS to determine which chip that potential detectin would land in.\n",
    "2. Once we know the chip, we use the RA/Dec and the WCS of that chip to determine which x, y on the chip the detection corresponds to.\n",
    "3. Then we use that x, y position to determine if the detection lands within the chip boundaries proceed to the next step.  If the detection is outside the chip boundary, i.e. in the gaps between chips or just outside the periphery of the mosaic of chips, the detection is lost.\n",
    "4. We use the same chip-level x,y position to determine if the detection lands within or near enough to a cell.  If it doesn't (i.e. it is in the 'streets' between cells) the detection is lost.  If the detection lands within a cell, determine which cell and determine the pixel position within the cell.\n",
    "5. Look up in the cell summary for that chip. If the cell is live, proceed to the next step.  Otherwise the detection is lost.\n",
    "6. Probe the mask data for that detector, cell, and pixel position. If the mask values for that pixel, and possibly nearby pixels, indicate a problem, the detection is lost.  Otherwise, proceed.\n",
    "7. Look up the detection efficiency curve for stationary sources for the chip in question. [Consider the idea of tracer particles to better same the detection efficiency as a function of magnitude, Jones and Juric].  [Matt P's point here about how being on live pixels is independent of magnitude is very helpful.]\n",
    "8. Take the magnitude of the possible source from the model, in the exposure's filter, and add appropriate random noise.  This might be just shot noise, but it might include other sources of noise.  There is a lot of useful values, such as the sky noise, in the headers.  We might need to account for trailing at this point to.  \n",
    "9. Compare this magnitude to the detection efficiency curve and draw a random number to determine if the detection occurs in the simulation.  If it does not, the detection is lost.  Otherwise, proceed.\n",
    "10. At this point we need to generate a synthetic row for an smf file. We are not inserting rows into the orginal file, but into separate files.  The synthetic rows should have all the values as the actual detections in an smf.  Many have already be genereated in the proceeding steps, but others will need to be created.  For example, we will need the flags and the shape moments.  We can make placeholder values for anything that will not be used later, but if we are going to use it, we need to generate it.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are 182 extensions in a standard smf.  These are:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "+ MATCHED_REFS contains information about the referencd stars that were used to determine the astrometric solution and photometric zero point for the overall exposure as well as for each detector.  MATCHED_REFS has both header information and data.  The data is a binary table of the stars used.  It's incredibly useful!\n",

    "The PS1 detectors are orthogonal transfer arrays (OTAs).  They can be read out very quickly, and individual cells can be accessed.  However, because these are prototype detectors, there are many defects.  There are also intra-cell streets and inter-detector gaps.  Fortunately, there are 'static masks' that record the characteristics of each pixel.  These are available to help make sense of the detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A static mask is itself a multi-extenion FITS file with 65 extensions. \n",
    "- The first is a PRIMARY extension with the details.\n",
    "- The remaining 64 correspond to the 8x8 grid of cells within a detector, each of which is referred to by a name such as 'xy23'.  The lower case 'xy' means cell.  The upper case 'XY' means chip or detector.\n",
    "- For each cell there is a 590 x 598 array of 16 bit integers.\n",
    "- The integers themselves are bit masks that encode information about each cell.\n",
    "- What each bit value means in the primary exentions header, as well as in the header of each cell file.  \n",
    "- So, overall there are 60 detectors, each with 64 cells, each of which is a 590x598 array of 16-bit integers.   1.4 giga-pixels, with each pixel being a 16-bit integer.  That's a lot of data, but it can be held in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the orientation of axes.  That's a huge pain!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that naxis1=590 and naxis2=598, but the shape of the data is 598, 590.  This is a basic difference between numpy and the old FITS fortran world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The static masks are rarely updated.  Mostly the detectors stay the same.  Short term changes and other effects are encoded in dynamic masking.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's slow to load a full mask; we don't want to do that every time we need a value.  We need a data structure to maintain the mask data so that we can repeatedly and quickly look up values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that we will load each mask data into a dictionary.\n",
    "- The keys are the detector names.  \n",
    "- The value for each detector is another dictionary,  keyed on the cell names.  \n",

    "The number of detections from a particular chip, or even cell, should be a function of the number of live pixels in it.  Dead pixels don't report photons.  Amazingly, there might be approaching 10^12 detections in the Pan-STARRS survey.  That estimate comes the product of 1.3x10^6 exposures and 1.5x10^5 detections/exposure.  The camera has 1.4x10^9 pixels.  That means that on average each pixel has been at the center of about 700 detections, some real and some false.\n",

In many cases we will know of a source that is predicted to be seen at a given pixel location.  We will have a prior estimate of its magnitude in various filters, which we can use to estimate the likelihood of detecting it.  Because there are so many exposures, most astrophysical objects that can be detected by Pan-STARRS will have been detected at some point.  Of course, there are some variable sources that might be only rarely detected and there are moving objects, the focus of this project, but these are a small fraction of the total.  We can use the known stationary and moving sources to estimate the true positive rate and false negative rate.\n",

Regardless, if a detection does not correspond to an object in the catalog, most likely it is false.  There are some detector regions with many more false detections.  Detections in those regions are more likely to be false.   We can use this information to estimate the true negative and false positve rates.\n",
