# Working directory for Jake's project
#
# Goal is to work towards a debiased survey for centaurs using Pan-STARRs data
# 
# There is a summary description in ... centaur_project_outline_20190520.pdf 
#
# There is a linked Dropbox directory called "smf" that contains a nuch of work done by Holman as he works towards his own project:
# - Some of the content in the "smf" directory will be of use while working towards this centaur survey project
#
# Initial Tasks: 20190620 
# - Get jupyter notebooks working on windows
# - Get familiar with plotting, etc, in jupyter notebooks
# - Get the "planet 9 orbits" part of the jupyter notebook "PS1_debiase.ipynb" working
# - Once the above is complete, chat more with Payne/Holman about next steps
#
# Tasks : 20190621
# - Now that linux & jupyter working on laptop, familiarize yourself with SyntheticPopn_1.ipynb
# - The SyntheticPopn_1.ipynb notebook contains just has the most important population-synthesis stuff in it without any of the extraneous file-dependent routines that were slowing-down the PS1_debias notebook
# - Work through the notebook and ensure the cells evaluate
# - Take notes / add comments / note questions where things are unclear: the notebook is currently very POORLY commented, so you/we need to work through and ensure you understand what's going on, and work to improve the comments/documentation. 
#
# Tasks : 20190622
# - Linux partition was too slow
# - MacBook laptop given to Jake 
# - MacBook needed to be set up with python, jupyter, various packages, Dropbox, etc etc
# - Some outstanding problems remain with the HEALPY installation, but that can wait until later
# - Jake to work on evaluating and understanding the synthetic models used for Planet-9 
# - Jake to work on understanding the approximate definitions of Centaurs
# - Jake to decide how to change the synthetic planet-9 model popn to make it a reasonable model for centaur (a, e, ...)
